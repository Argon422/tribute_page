        <p id="tribute-info">Alan Grant (February 9, 1949 – July 20, 2022)<br> Well known for his work at DC Comics, including <i>Batman</i>, <i>Lobo</i>, <i>The Demon</i> and the <i>L.E.G.I.O.N.</i> and was a long time writer of <i>Judge Dredd</i> and <i>2000AD</i>.<br>He is credited in 2842 issues.</p>

      <div class="achievments">
        <h2>These are some of his most notable career achievments:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In 1970, Grant met John Wagner, who was helping put together a new science fiction comic magazine, <i>2000 AD</i>, for IPC (International Publishing Company) a consumer magazine and digital publisher in the United Kingdom. Wagner was unable to complete his other work, so he asked Grant if he could help him write the Tarzan comic he was working on thus beginning the Wagner/Grant writing partnership</li>
          <br>
          <li>In the 80's, Grant worked mostly on <i>Judge Dredd</i>, a strip he created with Wagner that they had developed into the most popular feature in the magazine <i>2000 AD</i>.</li>
          <br>
          <li>By the late 1980s, Grant and Wagner moved into the American comic market. Their first title was the 12-issue <i>Outcasts</i> limited series (Oct. 1987–Sept. 1988) for DC Comics. Although it was not a success, it paved the way for the pair to write <i>Batman</i> stories in Detective Comics starting from issue 583 (Feb. 1988), with Norm Breyfogle on art duties for the titles. Grant and Wagner introduced <i>the Ventriloquist</i> in their first Batman story, as well as, <i>the Ratcatcher</i> in their third. After a dozen issues, Wagner left Grant to be the sole writer. Grant was one of the main Batman writers until the late 1990s.</li>
          <br>
          <li>In the 90's, Grant worked on <i>Lobo</i>, a character created by Keith Giffen, in a four-issue miniseries which was drawn by Simon Bisley. This was a parody of the 'dark, gritty' comics of the time and proved hugely popular. After several other miniseries (all written by Grant, sometimes with Giffen as co-writer), <i>Lobo</i> received his own ongoing series. In addition, Grant was writing <i>L.E.G.I.O.N.</i> (a <i>Legion of Super-Heroes</i> spin-off) and <i>The Demon</i> (a revival of Jack Kirby's character) for DC Comics. Grant later wrote the first issues of the new Batman title, <i>Batman: Shadow of the Bat</i>, which introuduced three new characters he created, <i>Jeremiah Arkham</i>, <i>Mr. Zsasz</i>, and <i>Amygdala</i>. The story arc, <i>"Batman: The Last Arkham"</i>, moved him into his role as one of the main writers during <i>the Knightfall</i> crossover. In 1994, Grant co-wrote the <i>Batman-Spawn: War Devil</i> intercompany crossover with Doug Moench and Chuck Dixon. Other Batman storylines which Grant contributed to include <i>"Contagion"</i>, <i>"Legacy"</i>, and <i>"Cataclysm"</i>.</li>
          <br>
          <li>By the end of the decade, Grant had written for virtually every American publisher of comic books, including DC, Marvel and Dark Horse.</li>
        </ul>
